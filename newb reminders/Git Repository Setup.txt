Basic git - init, add, commit, push/pull

Getting started with git? There is a lot of great documentation on git on the internet but I wanted something very basic to start with. I didn't find one so I have put together a git basics. I will show you how to create a repository, add files to it and committing your changes. I will keep to the basics so only the master branch will be touched.

Git works in a great way. You have one local repository and one remote repository. You commit to your local repository and push(commit to remote)/pull(get latest version) to and from your remote repository.


Start

First your local repository.
In your project folder initialize your repository:

git init

Add all your files so that they are ready for commit:

git add .

Commit all your files to the local repository:

git commit -a -> (add a message like "Initial commit")

Next you have to push our files to a remote repository. At github and gitorious you can add a remote project or setup one your self. Basically you setup a bare project ready to take your files.

This will tell your local repository where to push your files:

git remote add origin git@someserver.com:somerepository.git

Now you are ready to push:

git push origin master


Update

When you have done some changes you can check your status with:

git status

You commit your changes to your local repository:

git commit -a -> (add a message "Did som changes here and there")

Next you have to update your remote repository:

git push


Get latest version from remote repository:

git pull


That's it...

If you want someone to commit changes or if you want to get your code onto another machine type:

git clone git@someserver.com:somerepository.git
